			<div id="subheader">Automatic Speaker Profiling from Short Duration Speech Data</div>
			<div id="subsubheader">Abstract:</div>
			<p align="justify">
			Many paralinguistic applications of speech demand the extraction of information about the speaker characteristics from as little speech data as possible. In this work, we explore the estimation of multiple physical parameters of the speaker from the short duration of speech in a multilingual setting. We explore  different feature streams for age and body build estimation derived from the speech spectrum at different resolutions, namely - short-term log-mel spectrogram,  formant features and harmonic  features of the speech.  The statistics of these features over the speech recording are used to learn a support vector regression model for speaker age and body build estimation. The experiments  performed on the TIMIT dataset  show that each of the individual features is able to achieve results that outperform previously published results in height and age estimation. Furthermore, the estimation errors from these  different feature streams are complementary, which allows the  combination of estimates from these feature streams to further improve the results. The combined system from short audio snippets  achieves a performance of 5.2 cm, and 4.8 cm  in Mean Absolute Error (MAE) for male and female  respectively for height estimation. Similarly in age estimation the MAE is of 5.2 years, and 5.6 years for male, and female  speakers respectively. We also extend the same physical parameter estimation to other body build parameters like shoulder width, waist size and weight along with height on a dataset we collected for speaker profiling. The duration analysis of the proposed scheme shows that the state of the art results can be achieved using only around 1-2 seconds of speech data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to use a common set of features  for estimating the different physical traits of a speaker.

			<div id="subheader">A Deep Neural Network based End to End Model for Joint Height and Age Estimation from Short Duration Speech</div>
			<div id="subsubheader">Abstract:</div>
			<p align="justify">
			Automatic height and age prediction of a speaker has a wide variety of applications in speaker profiling, forensics etc. Often in such applications only a few seconds of speech data is available  to reliably estimate the speaker parameters. Traditionally, age and height were predicted separately using different estimation algorithms. In this work, we propose a unified DNN architecture to predict both height and age of a speaker for short durations of speech. A novel initialization scheme for the deep neural architecture is introduced, that avoids the requirement for a large training dataset. We evaluate the system on TIMIT dataset where the mean duration of speech segments is around 2.5s. The DNN  system is able to improve the age RMSE by at least 0.6 years as compared to a conventional support vector regression system trained on Gaussian Mixture Model  mean supervectors. The system achieves an RMSE error of 6.85 and 6.29cm for male and female height prediction. In case of age estimation, the RMSE errors are 7.60 and 8.63 years for male and female respectively. Analysis of shorter speech  segments reveals that even with 1 second speech input the performance degradation is at most 3% compared to the full duration speech files.

			<div id="subheader">Robust Features for Automatic Estimation of Physical Parameters from Speech</div>
			<div id="subsubheader">Abstract:</div>
			<p align="justify">
			Estimating speaker's physical parameters like height, weight and shoulder size can assist in voice forensics by providing additional knowledge about the speaker. In this work, statistics of the components of background GMM are employed as features in estimating the physical parameters. These features improved the performance of height and shoulder size estimation as compared to our earlier attempt based on a Bag of Word representation. The robustness of the features is validated using two different training subsets containing different languages.

			<div id="subheader">Estimating Multiple Physical Parameters from Speech Data</div>
			<div id="subsubheader">Abstract:</div>
			<p align="justify">
			In this work, we explore prediction of different physical parameters from speech data. We aim to predict shoulder size and waist size of people from speech data in addition to the conventional height and weight parameters. A data-set with this information is created from 207 volunteers. A bag of words representation based on log magnitude spectrum is used as features. A support vector regression predicts the physical parameters from the bag of the words representation. The system is able to achieve a root mean square error of 6.6 cm for height estimation, 2.6cm for shoulder size, 7.1cm for waist size and 8.9 kg for weight estimation. The results of height estimation is on par with state of the art results.

			<div id="subsubheader">Abstract:</div>
			<p align="justify">
			In this work, we try to study the effect of a wireless channel on physical parameter prediction based on speech data. Speech data from 207 speakers along with corresponding speaker's height and weight is collected. A three path Rayleigh fading channel with typical values of Doppler shift, path gain and path delay is utilized to create the mobile channel output audio. A Bag of Words (BoW) representation based on log magnitude spectrum is used as features. Support Vector Regression (SVR) predicts the physical parameter of the speaker from the BoW representation. The proposed system is able to achieve a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 6.6 cm for height estimation and 8.9 Kg for weight estimation for clean speech. The effect of Rayleigh channel increase the RMSE values to 8.17 cm and 11.84 Kg respectively for height and weight.
